# AoC2021
Everyday extends the abstract class puzzle which provides lots of useful methods and attributes to read in the input into lists and tables 
and other for AoC frequently needed processes like operations with adjacents and clone methods for multi-dimensional arrays.

In this repository to me particularly hard puzzles or my solutions I find quite pretty or unusual are uploaded.
